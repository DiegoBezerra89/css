### Results

I made a lot of progress on this course, I've never worked with Sass and for sure this tool is an essencial tool to help on my career as front-end developer.
I've improved my skills on:
- Clean code
- BEM (Block Element Modifier)
- DRY (Don't repeat Yourself)
- Media queries
- Sass folders structures
- Css Animations and effects without Js
- Responsive images
